            <h2>Sagada</h2>
            <p>
                Sagada is one of the filming locations of the romantic comedy 
                That Thing Called Tadhana. But the truth is, even before 
                the movie came out, I had visited Sagada multiple times and 
                noticed more and more people visiting each year. This increase 
                in visitors happened because it was becoming easier to get there, 
                tours were better organized, and more travelers were looking for 
                new places to explore. So, Sagada was already on its way to becoming 
                a well-known destination even before the movie made it even more famous.
