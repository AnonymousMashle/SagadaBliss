                    Before you start exploring, You must first know that the local government sets fixed prices <br>

                    have a guide with you.

                        <p>
                            Malboro Hills is one of the most beautiful spots 
                            in Sagada because of its stunning views like
                            the sunrise, sea of clouds and rolling hills.
                            To catch the sunrise and the sea of clouds, you must 
                            leave at 4:30 am earlier and drive to the jump or  off 
                            point. 
                            <span class="read-more-text">
                                From there, you will be hiking for about 20 minutes 
                                to reach the viewpoint. There are also kiosks selling champorado, 
                                sopas, and arroz caldo on site.

                                The trek takes around 2 hours, depending also on your pace. But the 
                                whole activity from pick up and
                                Marlboro sunrise to the end of the trek lasts 4-5 hours.
                                
                                Blue Soil is a unique natural wonder found in Sagada. 
                                The soil here has a cool blue color, which
                                makes it really special. This happens because of 
                                certain minerals in the ground.

                            Deep beneath Sagada lies a bunch of caves, and the biggest and the most
                            famous one is called Sumaguing Cave, also known as "The Big Cave."
                            When you go inside, you'll see lots of rocks and pools of water
                            that sparkle. Inside are countless rock formations slowly
                            shaped by nature over thousands of years.

                                Some of these rocks
                                look like all sorts of things, like pregnant women, elephants,
                                curtain, snake and even chocolate cakes. 

                                When you go inside, expect to get a little wet and do some climbing. 
                                But don't worry, it's not as hard as it seems. Just listen to your 
                                guide, and you'll be okay. 

                                The whole adventure usually takes about 2-4 hours because it depends on
                                your pace, it also depends on how many tourists goes inside simultaneously.

                            THE LUMIANG CAVE IS HOME to 100 ancient coffins. 
                            Stacked one on top of the other, these coffins 
                            form an eye-catching wall at the entrance of the 
                            cave that rises nine layers high. 
                            <span class="read-more-text">
                                It has been estimated that the oldest coffins are around 500 
                                years old.

                                The coffins were placed at the entrance to protect 
                                them from the elements, but in the same token, so 
                                they could receive daylight that wards off evil 
                                spirits that may disturb these souls’ eternal rest. 
                                The coffins are very strange, as they are quite small 
                                for a full-grown adult. It’s believed the corpses were 
                                laid in the coffins in a fetal position. It was done so 
                                that the deceased could exit this life the same as they entered.

                            THE PEOPLE OF SAGADA FOLLOW a unique burial ritual. 
                            The elderly carve their own coffins out of hollowed logs. 
                            If they are too weak or ill, their families prepare their 
                            coffins instead. The dead are placed inside their coffins 
                            (sometimes breaking their bones in the process of fitting them in), 
                            and the coffins are brought to a cave for burial.
                            <span class="read-more-text">
                                Instead of being placed into the ground, the coffins are 
                                hung either inside the caves or on the face of the cliffs, 
                                near the hanging coffins of their ancestors. The Sagada people 
                                have been practicing such burials for over 2,000 years, and 
                                some of the coffins are well over a century old. Eventually the 
                                coffins deteriorate and fall from their precarious positions.

                                The reason the coffins were hung was due to the belief that the 
                                higher the dead were placed, the greater chance of their spirits 
                                reaching a higher nature in the afterlife. Many of the locations of 
                                the coffins are difficult to reach (and obviously should be left 
                                alone out of respect), but can be appreciated from afar.

                            Bomod-ok Falls is also called the Big Falls because, well, 
                            it is definitely bigger than Bokong Falls, another popular 
                            waterfall in Sagada. Hidden deep in a valley, it takes an hour 
                            to two to get here by foot from the main road (and that’s just 
                            one-way).

                                Bomod-ok’s cold, cold water cascades from the top of 
                                a beautiful naturally contoured cliff to a pool below, forming a 
                                200-ft column of water and wonder.

                                The start of the trek was easy. The concrete path that leads to 
                                the falls is actually easy to walk on. It also provides visitors 
                                spectacular views of the terraces, the hills, the valley. It also 
                                allows a quick glimpse into the lifestyle of the community. On the way 
                                there, you'll realize how difficult it must be to live here — walking long 
                                distances. you will also likely to come across locals, men and women, who would effortlessly 
                                trod in between rice paddies while carrying sacks of produce on their back.
